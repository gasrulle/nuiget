# Changelog

All notable changes to the nUIget extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **View Package Details from Sidebar** — Right-click any package in the sidebar and select "View Package Details" to open the main panel with the package searched, selected, and its details displayed (including README tab)
- **Main Panel → Sidebar Sync** — Installing, updating, or removing packages in the main panel now automatically refreshes the sidebar (badge count, installed list, and updates)

### Fixed

- **Sidebar badge not showing until section expanded**
- **Refresh button not clearing stale update data**
- **"Update to Version" context menu installing directly instead of showing version picker**
- **Background update check blocked on refresh**
- **Sidebar updates not refreshing on external .csproj changes (e.g. git checkout)**

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- **Native Sidebar Styling** — Search input now matches the Extensions view (wrapper with clear button), section chevrons use SVG with rotation animation, section headers match native VS Code padding and height
- **Activity Bar badge removed** — Section header badges now provide update counts; the Activity Bar icon badge has been removed
- **Extensions-style sidebar search** — Search box now works like VS Code Extensions view: plain text searches NuGet with 300ms debounce (min 2 chars), `@installed` filters installed packages, `@updates` filters updates. Typing `@` shows an auto-completing filter dropdown. Sections hidden during search; Installed + Updates sections shown by default.

### Removed

- **Recent searches**
- **Browse section header**

### Fixed

- **Activity Bar badge race condition**

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Conditional sidebar visibility** — Activity Bar icon and sidebar only appear when the workspace contains compatible project files (.csproj, .fsproj, .vbproj). Dynamically updates when project files are added or removed.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Sidebar Panel** — Brand new Activity Bar panel with Browse, Installed, and Updates sections in a compact single-column layout. Always uses lite mode for maximum speed. Source/project/prerelease selection via title bar QuickPick commands. Package actions via hover buttons and right-click context menus. Update badge on the Activity Bar icon. Cross-view sync with the main panel.
- **Sidebar Keyboard Navigation** — Arrow Up/Down, Home/End, Enter, Ctrl+Enter (install/update), and Delete (uninstall) in sidebar package lists, matching the main panel's keyboard behavior
- **Sidebar Background Update Monitoring** — Updates are checked automatically in the background (5s after activation, on project file changes, and every 10 minutes). The Activity Bar badge shows the update count without needing to open the sidebar.
- **Cross-panel source & project sync** — Source and project selections are now shared bidirectionally between the main panel and sidebar. Changing either in one view updates the other in real time.
- **Sidebar default collapsed sections** — All sidebar sections start collapsed for a cleaner initial look. Searching auto-expands the Browse section.
- **Keyboard shortcut hints in tooltips** — Action buttons now show keyboard shortcuts in parentheses (e.g., Install (Enter), Uninstall (Del), Clear filter (Esc))

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Load All Projects Updates** — New "Load all projects" checkbox on the Updates tab that loads and displays package updates from all projects in the workspace simultaneously. Results are grouped by project with headers. Bulk "Update All" works across all projects with per-project output logging. Speeds up multi-project workspaces by skipping metadata (icons, authors, verified status) during load.

### Changed

- **Project dropdown sorting**

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Marketplace showing "Works with: Universal" instead of Desktop**

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Refresh Button Not Retrying Sources**
- **Package Details Missing Published Date**

### Changed

- **Failed Endpoint Cache TTL Increased to 120s**
- **Refresh Button Moved to Direct Packages Header**
- **Unified Metadata Fetching (2× Fewer HTTP Calls)**
- **Sliding-Window Concurrency**
- **Verified Badge in Package Details Panel**

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-11

- **Notification Spam During Batch Uninstall**

### Fixed

- **Slow Installed Tab with Unreachable Sources**
- **Redundant project.assets.json Parsing**
- **Transitive Prefetch Network Contention**

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Installed Tab Filter** - Compact client-side filter input on the Installed tab to quickly find packages by ID. Case-insensitive contains match, no HTTP calls. Clear button (×) and Escape key to reset. Header shows filtered count (e.g., "3 of 12"). Persists across tab switches, clears on panel close.
